---

## 1. Findings Summary

The cryptographic scan conducted in **Part 2** analyzed a total of **72 vulnerabilities** across Python source code files. These vulnerabilities were identified and categorized based on their severity, quantum vulnerability status, and specific cryptographic primitives or configurations used.

### **Total Files and Vulnerabilities**
- **Number of Files Scanned**: 42 (Python Files Only)
- **Total Vulnerabilities Identified**: 72
  - **Critical Issues**: 54
  - **High Issues**: 5
  - **Medium Issues**: 13

### **Breakdown by Severity**
- **Critical Issues (75% of findings)**: These vulnerabilities pose immediate risks to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system and must be addressed as a top priority. Examples include:
  - **Outdated Cryptographic Primitives**:
    - Use of MD5 and SHA-1 for hashing.
    - DES and RC4 for encryption.
  - **Weak Configurations**:
    - AES in ECB mode, which leaks plaintext patterns.
    - Static IVs in CBC mode, leading to predictable ciphertext.
  - **Hardcoded Secrets**:
    - Embedded API keys and credentials directly in source code.
  - **Deprecated Protocols**:
    - Use of SSLv3 and TLSv1.0.

- **High Issues (7% of findings)**: These vulnerabilities relate to quantum vulnerability or deprecated practices that, while not immediately critical, require significant remediation. Examples include:
  - Use of **deprecated ECC curves** (e.g., SECP192R1).
  - Quantum vulnerability in RSA-2048 and ECDH key exchanges.

- **Medium Issues (18% of findings)**: These issues involve weak parameterization or general warnings for cryptographic usage. While not immediately exploitable, they weaken overall system security. Examples include:
  - Default parameters in **Argon2** and **bcrypt**.
  - Generic usage of cryptographic libraries requiring review.

### **Quantum Vulnerability Analysis**
Out of the 72 vulnerabilities:
- **Quantum-Vulnerable Issues**: 30%
  - Examples:
    - ECC curves like SECP192R1 are vulnerable to quantum attacks.
    - RSA keys ≤ 2048 bits susceptible to Shor’s algorithm.

### **Key Insights from Part 2 Results**
- **Most Frequent Critical Issues**:
  - Outdated hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1) appear in 12 findings, comprising **16.6% of total findings**.
  - AES in ECB mode is another recurring issue, observed in multiple files.
- **Notable Quantum Vulnerable Findings**:
  - RSA-1024 and RSA-2048 keys (10 occurrences) require migration to post-quantum algorithms such as Kyber.
  - Deprecated ECC curves like SECP192R1 flagged as needing replacement.
- **Common Weak Configurations**:
  - Static IVs in CBC mode and weak PRNG usage.
  - Hardcoded keys or credentials embedded in code.

### **Risk Reduction Potential**
Remediation efforts, as outlined in the migration roadmap, aim to:
- **Eliminate 100% of critical vulnerabilities** through immediate fixes in Phase 1.
- **Address all quantum-vulnerable issues** by transitioning to post-quantum cryptography in Phase 3.
- **Achieve compliance** with cryptographic standards such as **NIST SP 800-57**, **NIST PQC standards**, and **ENISA PQC guidelines**.
